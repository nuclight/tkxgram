# Architecture of SQLite Database

## Requirements

Using ideas at [SQLite forum post](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5e93e18fa9) as a start point of thinking (a must read to understand what is below).

We need to have somewhat universal storage of objects, which also could be called "documents" for MongoDB people, but may be real blessed Perl classes - [EAV/CR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model).

However, some types of them need different metadata.

Messages need, at least:

 * deleted flag
 * unseen/unread flag
 * score

Files need:

* path to file in cache
* MD5, may be?
* some grouping - several files may be for same picture in different resolutions

### Plugin data

Variants of plugins (in respect to storage) we want to support, are, at least:

* annotating an object with text, e.g. OCR of meme picture - to be searchable by text
* layer of presenting instead of - e.g. a GPG encrypted/decrypted version of message

### Peering support

For ability to circumvent e.g. bans (personal or like "this channel marked porno so not available in your country") some way of interchanging objects between different people's databases is needed.
So a version of object need to have at least:

* received from this peer
* time of this version (time range?)
* schema version
* ??? which software version wrote this object?

Other questions need to be considered:

- what to do if objects from different peers mismatch? (maliciuos peer?)
- how to somewhat efficiently scan for new objects to send to peer, e.g. "in today batch" ?

### Query like XPath/DPath/MongoDB

As this is historical data storage, and may be of different protocols, some universal way to find object should exist, like by any leaf value, e.g. any text string. And consider some internal structure in such queries, as schema of object may change in time.

## Examples of objects and their versions - what we should store efficiently

**Example 1.** Consider following relatively raw example of message object, which also includes some other file objects:

```perl
    'message' => bless( {
      'from_id' => bless( {
        'user_id' => 123456789
      }, 'Telegram::PeerUser' ),
      'id' => 92437,
      'flags' => 8389380,
      'media' => bless( {
        'flags' => 1,
        'photo' => bless( {
          'sizes' => [
            bless( {
              'type' => 'i',    # means inline image thumbnail data
              'bytes' => '^A($<A6><A7><A0>^X<A7><AC>N<EC>2<A3><93><8E>^M<^A^Z^F^X^Y^]<E9><A6>r<84>...long bytestring stripped...P^G'
            }, 'Telegram::PhotoStrippedSize' ),
            bless( {
              'w' => 286,
              'type' => 'm',
              'h' => 320,
              'size' => 28361
            }, 'Telegram::PhotoSize' ),
            bless( {
              'h' => 800,
              'type' => 'x',
              'w' => 714,
              'size' => 105315
            }, 'Telegram::PhotoSize' ),
            bless( {
              'sizes' => [
                15636,
                38692,
                77746,
                107586,
                121261
              ],
              'h' => 1028,
              'w' => 918,
              'type' => 'y'
            }, 'Telegram::PhotoSizeProgressive' )
          ],
          'date' => 1651091496,
          'access_hash' => '-7392190489400277356',
          'id' => '5425109394036734746',
          'dc_id' => 2,
          'file_reference' => '^BC\\^X<D8>^@^Ai^Ubi<DA><ED>|@<DF>A9>^T<E3><C6>w<CB>1<F2>',
          'flags' => 0
        }, 'Telegram::Photo' )
      }, 'Telegram::MessageMediaPhoto' ),
      'replies' => bless( {
        'replies_pts' => 94010,
        'replies' => 0,
        'flags' => 0
      }, 'Telegram::MessageReplies' ),
      'reply_to' => bless( {
         'reply_to_msg_id' => 634609,
	 'reply_to_top_id' => 292840,
          'flags' => 0
      }, 'Telegram::MessageReplyHeader' ),
      'fwd_from' => bless( {
        'date' => 1651091496,
        'flags' => 32,
        'from_name' => 'Some User'
      }, 'Telegram::MessageFwdHeader' ),
      'message' => 'here goes message text, may be short, may be as long as even 4 Kbytes!',
      'peer_id' => bless( {
        'channel_id' => 1123581119
      }, 'Telegram::PeerChannel' ),
      'date' => 1651091930
    }, 'Telegram::Message' ),
```

**Example 2.** Original (unedited) message:

```perl
    'message' => bless( {
      'peer_id' => bless( {
        'channel_id' => 1194168656

              }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonCallback' )
            ]
          }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonRow' )
        ]
      }, 'Telegram::ReplyInlineMarkup' ),
      'media' => bless( {

      }, 'Telegram::MessageMediaWebPage' ),
      'date' => 1645507727,
      'post' => 1,

              }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonCallback' )
            ]
          }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonRow' )
        ]
      }, 'Telegram::ReplyInlineMarkup' ),
      'views' => 2
    }, 'Telegram::Message' )
```

**Example 4.** Last edit:

      'edit_hide' => 1,
      'forwards' => 36
    }, 'Telegram::Message' ),

```

**Example 5.** And object without edit date in it (only creation date), though fields may change in time:


```perl
  bless( {
    'id' => 1194168656,
    'min' => 1,
    'date' => 1571057257,
    'photo' => bless( {
      'stripped_thumb' => '^A^H^H<98><AC><9B><81>^\<AF>z(<A2><B9>&<96><86><E9><9F>',
      'flags' => 2,
      'photo_id' => '5222279361619669161',
      'dc_id' => 2
    }, 'Telegram::ChatPhoto' ),
    'flags' => 1060960,
    'has_link' => 1,
    'username' => 'history_chill',
    'broadcast' => 1,
    'title' => 'Heestorie on Leisure',
    'access_hash' => '-1935335668194123456'
  }, 'Telegram::Channel' )
```

**Example 6.** And finally object without any date in it, though `status` field changes often, other names may be changed also:

```perl
  bless( {
    'status' => bless( {}, 'Telegram::UserStatusRecently' ),
    'photo' => bless( {
      'stripped_thumb' => '^A^H^Hr‹π<9B>^D^M<BF>N<94>QEf<E4><FB><97> è',
      'photo_id' => '911160643534564107',
      'dc_id' => 2,
      'flags' => 2
    }, 'Telegram::UserProfilePhoto' ),
    'last_name' => 'A hidden',
    'access_hash' => '-2789501974264567890',
    'first_name' => 'Alexander',
    'flags' => 1048679,
    'min' => 1,
    'id' => 212146119
  }, 'Telegram::User' )

```

### Sub-objects problem

As it can be seen, raw objects often include other objects with their own IDs, which could be requested independently from server by other methods - e.g. files, or webpage previews. Thus, these need in fact be stored as separate objects in DB - so, a some way to **reference** them to "include" or "mount" is needed. But this interferences with versions - e.g. one edit of message could reference one file or webpage, other edit could reference another one. So this "references" must point to concrete versions - and if versions are _inside_ of `inode`, we have a problem.

## Individual object/versions storage thoughts

So let's brainstorm how we can store all such versions efficiently, avoiding duplicating data.

### C object graph / memory dump - variant 0

Imagine we have machine with 1 TB memory and unbreakable power, so we don't need a database - how would store objects Perl itself in memory? It will have a bunch of SV, AV and HV objects with refcounts, which maps to DB tables very simply - just put ID's instead of reference pointers in memory. Given helper hashes to index e.g. long PV's to avoid duplicate data, this will also be very effective storage!

However, how would we query such database for questions like "give me root objects where strings contain this word at any level deep" ? This would require a truly graph-oriented DB or at least some subset, with DAG paths. Even if we use some workaround knowing it's DAG starting only at objects of some type, there will be still too many paths in graph with every elementary object as a node.

Also, it won't be _most_ effective storage with respect to diffs - consider hash with 30 members, a new version will duplicate all 30 elements even if only one is edited; finding some base text (PV) for a diff (e.g. a typo edit) would be difficult, too.

### Everything in CBOR, texts outside, deltas - variant 1

Put every string into special `texts` table, which is FTS4 or FTS5 one - for searching. Then, every document is serialized into CBOR with text strings changed to special integer tags, and stored as BLOB. Every version must be stored as separate CBOR, or it may have `delta_to` field with ID of BLOB to which we are diff - for this, [Fossil Delta](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file?name=ext/misc/fossildelta.c&ci=tip) or similar must be used.

For searching texts, there must be a table which maps CBOR BLOB id to texts IDs.

For searching other values, [Application-defined SQL function](https://sqlite.org/appfunc.html) must be exported like e.g. `cbor_extract(path...)` and then [Indexes On Expressions](https://sqlite.org/expridx.html) must be utilized.

PROs:

* serializing and deserializing from CBOR is very simple and can support any data
* given auxiliary object with every field name in database, using [Repeated string compression CBOR Tag](http://cbor.schmorp.de/stringref) (combined with some help like prepending aux object and deleting it) will also yield very compact storage - just about two integers for every 'key => value' pair

CONs:

* requires relatively new SQLite for indexes on expressions and compiling/loading delta extension - may be difficult on some ~~ancient~~ stable distros
* every index on every field must be created individually, and this may change when schema of objects changes - maintenance burden

### Hybrid model, CBOR plus leaf values - variant 2

Consider that in Data::Dumper examples above output is, with except of container (`[`/`{`/`bless`) lines, formatted with one scalar value per line, which could be called "leaf" value, if we represent an object as a tree.

Let's put them into table where each row will correspond to one line of dump, with key in one column and value in another. First, as key names in hashes repeat often, define auxiliary table to store only numbers:

**Attribute_name table:**

| id | name |
|----|------|
| INT| TEXT |

For arrays in dump, let it pretend that "key name" is a number - that is, value index in array. Now, our main main values table will have just number for both key name or index, and a flag to distinguish them.

**Leaf values table:**

| id | is_array | reftype | cbor_tag |nameidx | value | value_aux |
|----|----------|---------|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| INT| BOOL | what is val | usually NULL | key name or array index | actual value or reference | helper, e.g. hash of text |

**TBD** merge `reftype` and `cbor_tag`? or make individual fields for JOIN on texts and employ `CHECK()` constraints of only one non-NULL of them?

Now, we can have `INDEX ON (nameidx, value)` and so... Just query like `WHERE key = 'user_id' AND value = 123456789` (conceptually, as JOINs will complicate actual queries).

We still need to keep tree structure of objects somehow. Luckily, [CBOR Tag 26](http://cbor.schmorp.de/perl-object) does not mandate rigid format, so arguments in arrays may be just IDs from leaf values table - very efficient, even more than [stringref](http://cbor.schmorp.de/stringref) (tags 25/256), except that some subtleties of storing container names must be resolved (probably with some custom CBOR tag).

And now, for searching from leaf values to master object, we have table:

**Object to leaf table**:

| entity_id | leaf_id |
|-----------|---------|
|   INT     |  INT    |

with _superset_ of all leaf values of all versions for this object. Why superset? If we'll keep matching for every version, this becomes very space-consuming for each versions - most rows will duplicate! And we still not yet have structure instead of plain rows...

Then, for structure of versions, we'll have:

| entity_id | version | CBOR |
|-----------|---------|------|
|   INT     |  INT    | BLOB |

with just structure of each object in it, consisting of just INTs and tags in CBOR.

Discussion:

* PRO: storing those INTs in CBOR is somewhat more space-efficient than in SQLite table
* PRO: no more maintenance pain of individual expression indexes!
* CON: indexes on everything will take significant amount of space
* PRO: from every leaf value search, we immediately have master object, without any intermediate version
* CON: if we want a version, we must deserialize & scan **all** CBOR BLOBs for master object - what if there are too many of them?
* PRO/CON: but user usually wants a master object, so no need for additional query to get master from version, in many cases
* CON: self cross-join problem to filter on - hard to build queries
* not so CON: only leaf matching, no paths in structure - user must deal with later-different-meaning but same-named fields (e.g. `reply_to` could be INT, but later became object like in example 1), etc.

### A non-CBOR but SQL+FTS - variant 3

The [Data::DPath](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::DPath) module allows one to make XPath-like queries against Perl object, with requests like `'//.[isa("Telegram::Message")]/peer_id/channel_id[value==1383907943]/../../../../../..'` - and while full support of it's language in SQL database would require too much effort and will consume too much space for indexes, having at least _some_ of it's features would be handy for long-term history data storage, when schema changes over time, and old objects could not be converted. As you can see, the "leaf values table" from variant 2 is essentially having last part of this path, bound to tail (with always enough `/../` to root of object).

Meanwhile, consider the textual form of examples 3 and 4 - if we'd run a `diff -u` on them, we'd get a fragment like:

```diff
      'post' => 1,
-     'edit_date' => 1645507730,
+     'edit_date' => 1648838557,
+     'edit_hide' => 1,
      'reply_markup' => bless( {
        'rows' => [
          bless( {
            'buttons' => [
              bless( {
-               'text' => 'üß°',
+               'text' => 'üß° 168',
                'data' => 'send_reaction_0',
                'flags' => 0
              }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonCallback' ),
              bless( {
                'flags' => 0,
-               'text' => 'üñ§',
+               'text' => 'üñ§ 8',
                'data' => 'send_reaction_1'
              }, 'Telegram::KeyboardButtonCallback' )
```

with all other lines, some of them very long lines - unchanged! What if could store big objects and their small diffs in DB like that?..

Anyone who have seen subtrees output from `sysctl` command will immediately get the idea. Let's depict how we could recreate some lines from examples 1, 3 and 4 one value at a time:

```perl
# of obj path elem 1      elem 2    elem 3    elem 4  elem 5     leaf table name/idx and value
$root    ->{reply_markup} ->{rows}  ->[0]                        ->{data} = 'send_reaction_0';
$root    ->{reply_markup} ->{rows}  ->[1]                        ->{text} = 'üß° 168';
$root    ->{media}        ->{photo} ->{sizes} ->[3]   ->{sizes}  ->[4]    = 121261;
```

Of course, in addition to autovivification we'll need class information (to bless) here. First, let's define auxiliary class information table, with base/child class relationships:

| id (INT) | parent (INT) | class_name (TEXT) |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| 0 | NULL | '' |
| 1 | NULL | 'Telegram::Message' |
| 2 | 1 | 'Telegram::ServiceMessage' |

Now, modify **Object to leaf table** from variant 2 to two tables:

**Object_value_plus** and **Object_value_minus** tables, of the same schema:

| object_id | ipath_id | leaf_id |
|-----------|----------|---------|
|    INT    |    INT   |   INT   |

Each row will correspond to perl depict above, but with either included or excluded, and each object now has `diff_to` property - from which to borrow path/values, or vice versa, to include (non-diff object will have rows only in `plus` table`).

And, of course, the most interesting part...

**Internal paths table** `USING fts5`:

| ipath_id (INT) | name_path (TEXT) | class_path (TEXT) |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
|        0       |   ''            |       ''       |
|        1       |   '3'           |      '0'       |
|        2       |   'a b'         |      'cd ef'   |

This is a table with two text columns indexed by full text search. Many attempts to save space are made. Only unique paths are placed here, having just a compact integer ID in referencing leaves. Root and leaf are never part of path, so for common case "object is just a hash with no subobjects" the path will be empty.

Then, IDs constituing path from `Attribute_name` table are base32-encoded, most significant bit will show, is it array index or hash key. And this "words" are placed into `name_path` column.

For classes, things are more complicated, given that we have to support inheritance. Zero class is no class (for just plain hashrefs and arrayrefs). All others are constructed as words from Unicode characters, where each character, from left to right, has number (`ord()`) from class table, in order of inheritance chain.

For example, if class number encoded to `'d'` character is child of class whose number is encoded to `'c'` character, and current element in path is blessed to `'d'` class, then word becomes `'cd'`. If it is `'e'` class, whose parent is `'d'` - then `'cde'`, and so on.

This allows to make FTS queries like `"c*"` - so FTS engine will match base class and all it's descendants for us. If we need only `'d'` class, we'll put `"cd*"` in query, and so on.

PROs:

* no CBOR / Delta / app functions: ability to work on out-of-the-box SQLite found in old distros
* diff algorithm is more suited to nature of data, instead of more generic Fossil Delta (which would also depend on sort order inside blob)
* probably most possible indexing/matching capabilities from the unmodified SQL DB, without writing any C code for graphs or manual indexes

CONs:

* still the same self cross-join problem as in variant 2
* hard work to support from application
* either had to cache in memory "words" for classes and attributes or issue many queries
* limit of 1 million classes, no multiple inheritance
* need to somehow to find a good candidate for diff - this is again not a group of versions, but individual objects
* complicated queries with compound SELECT - probably will support only one level "delta to base", not "delta to delta"

## TBD / Still open questions

1. A structure of directory/inode tree table - is one-element enough, or do we need additional fields? E.g. object's path

   `/Telegram/chat=1234&message=2345/some`

   would correspond to table

   | id | d_name | chat | message | parent | inode |
   |----|--------|------|---------|--------|-------|
   |  1 |Telegram| NULL | NULL    |   NULL | NULL  |
   |  2 | NULL   | 1234 | 2345    |    1   | NULL  |
   |  3 | some   | NULL | NULL    |    2   | 3456  |

   but this duplicates this fields on **every** directory level, even if they are not used - is it good for indexes?..

2. How to add needed flags to only those types, then? E.g. an `unread` flag is for entire message, not only all it's versions. And how to store versions? If we add some fields to **directory** table right of inode, to keep versions and flags:

   | id | d_name | chat | message | parent | inode |    time    | API_vers | from_peer | deleted | unread | score |
   |----|--------|------|---------|--------|-------|------------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
   |  1 |Telegram| NULL | NULL    |   NULL | NULL  |    NULL    |   NULL   |   NULL    |  NULL   | NULL   |    0  |
   |  2 | NULL   | 1234 | 2345    |    1   | NULL  |    NULL    |   NULL   |   NULL    |  NULL   | NULL   |    0  |
   |  3 | some   | NULL | NULL    |    2   | 3456  | 1650123456 | layer136 | localhost |  false  | true   |  200  |
   |  4 | some   | NULL | NULL    |    2   | 3457  | 1651234567 | layer138 | alexhost  |  false  | true   |  100  |

   then such fields will need to be

   * superset of all possible needed fields
   * some of them will be waste for most rows in directory (of different type)

   This is in fact repetition (in smaller scale) of EAV problem for objects itself, just without hierarchy this time.

   * so keep this in some table and JOIN with `classes` table? or even put a table name?..

3. How to store references to split objects, e.g. webpage outside of message? How to query against them? Repeat graph way from variant 3, but now with object IDs?

4. Augmentation of main objects (let's call this **public** part, even if that's of private message) with private/volatile feilds (e.g. `access_hash`, `file_reference`, `UserStatusOnline/expires`) - just repeat mini-objects on e.g. per-account path and then merge them? This echoes object "include/mount" problem.

       main: /Telegram/Chan1234/2345
       priv: /Telegram/Acc98/Chan1234/2345

   or inverse path? Finding all occurrences for message 2345 in channel 1234 under all accounts - could be expensive.

   -> no, let's have separate tables for this.

   | inode | account_id |  private  | volatile  | volatile_date
   |-------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------
   |  INT  |    INT     | CBOR BLOB | CBOR BLOB | DATE when what's in `volatile` was received from cloud

   and

   | inode | volatile | volatile_date
   |-------|----------|--------------
   |  INT  | CBOR BLOB | DATE when what's in `volatile` was received from cloud

   for globally non-private volatile XXX probably move this into main inode info, no need for separate 2-column table

   XXX UserStatusOnline/expires is really per version?

   or not. Reactions and read statuses require matrix, where `by_path` is e.g. user who made like reaction:

   | inode | account_id | by_path_id |    date   | data (CBOR BLOB)
   |-------|------------|-----------|------------|--------------
   | 12345 |    NULL    |    NULL   | 1650123456 | {views:67868}
   | 12345 |    NULL    |    2345   | 1650123456 | {reaction:"thumb_up"}
   | 12345 |    NULL    |    3456   | 1650123456 | {reaction:"thumb_up"}
   | 12345 |    NULL    |    4567   | 1650123456 | {reaction:"thumb_down"}
   | 12345 |    NULL    |    7890   | 1650123456 | {reaction:"shit"}
   | 12345 |      1     |    NULL   | 1650123456 | {access_hash:1234567890}
   | 12345 |      2     |    NULL   | 1650123456 | {access_hash:2345678901}

   - in theory this is like having edge in graph to user who reactioned, think about graph mechanism instead?
     - would require clusters/subgraphs also? because of _some_ versions pointing vs _all_ versions pointing
       - huh, use a "compound" object for inode/subgraph?

   - graphviz quote:

     > An edge statement allows a subgraph on both the left and right sides of the edge operator. When this occurs, an edge is created from every node on the left to every node on the right. For example, the specification
     >
     >     A -> {B C}
     >
     > is equivalent to
     >
     >     A -> B
     >     A -> C


5. Other "normal" relational table - how to mix without errors with all these?..

6. Purge pain.


**XXX**

still inode2versions table:

| inode | object_id |  obj_time  | API_version | writer_version | from_peer |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 3456  | 235678    | 1650123456 |  layer136   |   Teleperl 0.1 | localhost |
| 3456  | 235679    | 1651234567 |  layer138   |  TeleGayJS 0.2 | alexhost  |

and deleted/unread/score etc. - must be per-inode
- make it Rtree on object_id and move inode and software/peer columns to objects table
- ...or split info for some per-path, some per-inode? e.g. peer in inode, score in path?
- what if directory is just object and MQTT path is via hashes, like JSON-path, so hardlinks are just refs to same `{}` ?..
  - mutability problem?
  - pollutes key names for typical objects

## Feb 2024

if perl variant, then do we need SHA1 in each object? or SipHash and let get from DB to solve collisions? how to put new object?

files - put `file_glob` in each and every object? to have several files in cache

bless - not just class, but reference to type table which also has version, e.g. TL scheme constructor/layer

`sys_upd_date` ?

we (almost?) forced in Perl  (variant 0) due to server's bug - presence of
```perl
  ext_layers => {
    136 => {
      142306870 => 'Telegram::MessageReactions',
      739712882 => 'Telegram::Dialog'
    }
  },
  in => bless( {
...

```

TBD what if object from peers had different schema versions but same CBOR? do we need type list? then it must be separate table `(avhv_id, class, layer)` ?

- too much space, so let's do it per version object - as `ext_layers` are saved per big object in my logs; keep just class per AVHV
  - then, what to do in theoretical case that class could be radically changed in time, or at least it's relationships hierarchy?
    - such class/schema changes reminds of (unsolved) problem of moving/renaming files in Version Control Systems - no VCS has clean "inode" concept, workarounds everywhere...
    - _240420_ seems it's enough to somehow combine class name with layer (`ext_layers` example above), but then problem of FTS `prefix*` queries for `isa(*)`


TBD need more think about peer exchange, tosser - inbound/outbound metadata per object? per directory?

count of children in each directory - e.g. for display in user interface tree editor, for annotations etc.

what to do with generic graph query? As it seems to be that only needed search is from leafs to version, let's reduce graph queries to up-tree direction: combine Perl variant with internal paths from variant 3, just replace "leaf" with object_id of leaf_object

$dbh->sqlite_create_aggregate() for getting EAV as CBOR?

```sql
CREATE TBALE AVHV_body (
    avhv_id     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES AVHV_head ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
    array_idx   INTEGER,
    keyname     INTEGER REFERENCES attribute_names ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
    value       ANY,        -- direct small
    ref_texts   INTEGER REFERENCES PV_texts        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
    ref_bytes   INTEGER REFERENCES PV_bytes        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
    ref_object  INTEGER REFERENCES AVHV_head       ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
    CHECK(array_idx IS NULL AND keyname IS NOT NULL OR array_idx IS NOT NULL AND keyname IS NULL),
    CHECK(  -- value is either small embedded or one reference
            value IS NULL
            AND
            ref_texts IS NOT NULL
            AND
            ref_bytes IS NULL
            AND
            ref_object IS NULL
        OR
            value IS NULL
            ref_texts IS NULL
            AND
            ref_bytes IS NOT NULL
            AND
            ref_object IS NULL
        OR
            value IS NULL
            ref_texts IS NULL
            AND
            ref_bytes IS NULL
            AND
            ref_object IS NOT NULL
        OR
            value IS NOT NULL
            ref_texts IS NULL
            AND
            ref_bytes IS NULL
            AND
            ref_object IS NULL
        ),
    UNIQUE(avhv_id, array_idx, keyname, value, ref_texts, ref_bytes, ref_object)
);
```

now let's try to extract object and it's children...

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
    obj_children(avhv_id) AS (
        SELECT ?1
        UNION
        SELECT ref_object
          FROM obj_children JOIN AVHV_body USING avhv_id -- XXX which is right?
         WHERE AVHV_body.ref_object IS NOT NULL
        -- AND obj_children.avhv_id = AVHV_body.ref_object
    )
    SELECT * FROM AVHV_body JOIN obj_children USING (avhv_id)
             JOIN attribute_names ON keyname = attribute_names.id
    ;
```

TBD may be trigger instead of separate ref_ columns? 14 vs 17 bytes

# Compression

## Texts

FTS4 (not FTS5) has `compress=` and `uncompress=` options, so this should be used.

Have a table (crc32 INT, dictionary BLOB) ??? may be language_id also?

Don't compress texts less than 90 bytes as per RFC 2394 recommendation, or whose compressed versions expands more than uncompressed (in total length, with header described below). In compressed BLOB, first 3 bytes are `'?z\0'` (meaning gz, bz, xz, lz, ...) to be distinguishable from UTF8 text, next 1 byte is compressor (TODO: have them named in separate table?), then follows 4 bytes of CRC32 of dictionary used to compress. Then data which decompressor will understand. E.g. `deflate` allows 32 Kb dictionaries and checks them with CRC32.

TODO what if no dict - waste 4 zero bytes or reduce to 128 compressors?
-> make compressor SQLite varint format (actually Perl's `pack('w')`) so it can has flags and be extensible

As dictionaries are supposed to be cached in memory, as `deflate` has 32 Kb limit which will not waste much, there should not be many of them, so there is problem to have good dictionary. Possible way is to process corpus of texts for several years, split them to words (here Unicode normalization and FTS tokenizers must be taken into account), drop words with length 3 chars or less, sort words by rarest first frequent last then by length shortest last, and take `tail -c 32768` of this output as dictionary TBD eliminate space in this output?

TBD as edits are often just correcting typos, combine text compression with Fossil delta? Then need an algo to look for similar text to take as delta... edit versions are natural candidates, but that's not always the case, and may be possible from another group. Also, this contradicts to feature we want to support deleting edits (intermediate, oldest... for conserving space and preventing DoS against us with many edits) - this may require repacking other texts, and first have to find them!

## CBOR repeated strings

[CBOR::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/CBOR::XS) supports [repeated string compression CBOR Tag](http://cbor.schmorp.de/stringref). Actually, it is defined only on previous part of CBOR document itself, so the following hacky trick is employed: we create an outer array of two elements, first ([0]) will be array of strings which will serve as a dictionary, second is our actual data structure. On encoding the dictionary is prepended this way, then initial array byte and dictionary array are removed, leaving only relevant data structure (so if it happens it has no repeated strings from dictionary, it will be just equal to as encoded without all these complexities). On decoding, initial array byte and encoded dictionary array are prepened to CBOR BLOB, and then `decode_cbor($constructed_blob)->[1]` is returned.

The dictionary array of strings is obtained by:

```sql
SELECT name FROM attribute_name ORDER BY id LIMIT (
    SELECT value FROM db_settings WHERE param = 'cbor_dict_limit'
)
```

The limit is here as it takes memory to hash all dictionary strings, which can be unacceptable when database grows too large.

# TODO / TBD

unseen / unread / read @ time, to see new edits ...or just ctime?

refetch_access_lost for not deleted but bans?

on object splitting, how to find an INT id for reference to? create a way to have SHA256 of object?
- have we here problem of differentiating test / main cloud? supposedly **yes** - if just by leaf value, what if same ID collision on both test and main?
- or invent some "relative" addressing of IDs
- may be make a reference a "date (when was valid) + path" ? or take date range from source object itself?

variant: at INSERT populate `additional_section` (? a-la DNS ? or `outgoing_edge` ?) with links to object (concrete versions) to return with this, e.g. for `user` together with `message`; as Telegram returns users and chats
...but, querying and returning `chats` for every message could be expensive, and caller likely to have it in memory cache already
- still should be done for "mentioned" chats, however (not that which it belongs to)
- what with using this for compound objects? e.g. a local comment to picture will find picture by this, but what if there are too many messages referring to this picture?
- about name "compound object", should it be really used for "photo of different sizes" or "video + thumbnail? may be "package" ?

ipath=NULL for metadata

not inode, but versions also in tree, so distinguish tree children and attributes like XML/DOM ?

move `from_peer` in front of tree? this would be consistent with e.g. Telegram's "common box" messages, which are enumerated per-account - but conflicts with `unread` being per-message, not per-version... though it's interesting idea, what if received version differs from what was previously read by user in GUI ? the same problem with edited messages, BTW

...looks like need a table, one or more columns of it itself a path/tree - that is, not a "table inside a tree ['s node]", but a "tree (or more) inside a table" ?

the concept of FS-like tree and inodes was for hardlinks - e.g. `Telegram/commonbox/712345` and `Telegram/Chat/123/712345` is in fact the same message, as well as `Telegram/commonbox/712346` and `Telegram/User/456/712346` are also the same, due to continuous numeration of messages in old chats and private dialogs in Telegram

also, single tree is a natural fit for MQTT topics, for splitting by path to different DB shards, and for DB object browser with standard Tree Control widgets, Regedit-like - though latter possibly may be tree+table...
-> however, to support migration of objects between shards, still graph relations must exist (Sqlite::VersionedObjectGraph ?) - let's see https://github.com/dpapathanasiou/simple-graph
- and graph is probaly a must due to stickers - stickerSet references documents, each document is just a file with Sticker attribute pointing back to stickerSet

may be don't give any real sense to inode? i.e. just JOIN on it and nothing more?

yes, have `is_content` on versions - e.g. plugin-decoded GPG message also may have edits, as by original message; and probably just move unread/score to plugin object (with `unseen` being determined by number pointer in dialog, and `unread` being explicitly toggled by user)
- or NULL for content objects, and typename for plugin-objects - like HFS filesystem forks or NTFS streams?
- put info about cached files (e.g. images) to such plugin-objects also? but cached-file info is unversioned by it's nature...

can't have class/type in inode, must be in object - as reference from inode matrix may be for path which will be created just for this as we don't have real objects on it yet

use technique similar to SMTP's dot-stuffing in MQTT mapping (in following examples slashes are to show it's segment, they are not part of value):
* "/::string/" segment is "/:string/", that is, simple escaping of leading ":" itself
* ":I" means integer, e.g "/:I123456/" or "/:I-123" for negative
* ":F" means IEEE float (double), e.g. "/:F.05/" (0.05) or "/:F-2e-3/" (-0.002)
* ":N" means NULL (`undef` in Perl) __TBD__ what? in identifier? let's prohibit it
* TBD some way to encode chars prohibited in MQTT: U+0001..U+001F control characters, U+007F..U+009F control characters and "+" or "#"
  - may be ":\" and then \c[ and \x1b etc. like in Perl ?
* other variants after initial dot are currently an error, reserved for future extension
* probably URL-like percent-encoding is better, start with e.g. %i for Integer, %r for real, %25 if UTF-8 starts from %, and %U for base85 non-padded, %V for 1 byte pad, ...

   base85 variant - exclude 0x7f and 10 chars:
    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    sp "   #   $   '   +   /   \   {   }

Data::DPath is essentially a small graph query language, just limited to tree and not many functions - so making somewhat generic for graph queries solves DPath support problem, too...


what if no FS-like tree at all - just LDAP-like search on attributes like 'Telegram' & 'channel=...' & 'date>=...' ?

LDAP:
For example, an entry representing a person might belong to the classes "top" and "person". Membership in the "person" class would require the entry to contain the "sn" and "cn" attributes, and allow the entry also to contain "userPassword", "telephoneNumber", and other attributes. Since entries may have multiple ObjectClasses values, each entry has a complex of optional and mandatory attribute sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple ObjectClasses values that define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a class definition and an instance in Object-oriented programming, representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively.
* The baseObject scope (often referred to as just ‚Äúbase‚Äù) indicates that only the entry specified by the search base DN should be considered.
* The singleLevel scope (often referred to as ‚Äúone‚Äù or ‚Äúonelevel‚Äù) indicates that only entries immediately below the search base DN (but not the base entry itself) should be considered.
* The wholeSubtree scope (often referred to as ‚Äúsub‚Äù) indicates that the entry specified as the search base DN and all entries below it (to any depth) should be considered. 

Each RDN is comprised of name-value pairs. Every RDN must contain at least one pair (an attribute name followed by an equal sign and the value for that attribute), but you can include multiple name-value pairs in the same RDN by separating them with plus signs. For example, the RDN ‚Äúcn=John Doe+mail=jdoe@example.com‚Äù has a ‚Äúcn‚Äù value of ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù and a ‚Äúmail‚Äù value of ‚Äújdoe@example.com‚Äù. RDNs with multiple name-value pairs are called multivalued RDNs, and they are primarily used for cases in which it is not possible to guarantee that an RDN with a single component could be unique among entries at a given level of the hierarchy (e.g., there may be multiple users with a name of ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù but they probably all have different email addresses).

http://web.archive.org/web/20080130062857/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/392/shi.html :
> Another problem that we found with the intuitive solution mentioned above is that the OR operation does not perform well even for a small database with thousands of entries. Because it is using JOIN to combine the attribute tables and ldap_entry tables, DB2 will take a cross-product of all the rows in the attribute tables and the ldap_entry table for the OR operation. Even though most of the rows in the cross-product are irrelevant, the DB2 SQL engine dutifully reports all these rows, which are generally much more than are needed for the subquery evaluation.
> Our solution is based on the concept of EID sets. First, generate an SQL subquery for each LDAP operator based on the basic translation rules. The SQL subquery will generate a set of entry EIDs that match the LDAP basic operation. If the LDAP logical operator is OR, use UNION to unite the sets generated from the subquery. If the LDAP operator is AND, use INTERCEPT to intercept the sets generated from the subquery. We experimented with two different ways to put together the SQL query based on the EID set concept.
